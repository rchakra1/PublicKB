### What Is Blockchain?

A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, digital ledger used to record transactions across many computers. A record in the chain cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks.

### How Blockchain Works

Information held on a blockchain exists as a shared and continually reconciled database. The blockchain database isnâ€™t stored in any single location, meaning no centralized version exists for a hacker to exploit. Hosted by millions of computers simultaneously, its data is accessible to anyone on the internet.
